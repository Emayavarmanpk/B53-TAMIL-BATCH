# The first usable version of http was created in 1997.
# The first version of http called as Http1.1
# This version is still in use on the web.
# Http1.1 load resources one after the other,resources behind it.in contrast 


Http2:-

# The new version of Http 2 is launced in 2015.
# Http2 is much faster and more efficient than http1.1
# One of the ways in which http2 is faster is in how it priorities content during the loading process.
# When a client makes a request for a webpage,the server sends several streamsof data th the client at once
# Instead of sending one thing after another,thuis method of delivery is known as mulitiplexing.
